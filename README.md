Challenge 04 - Code Quiz
For this assignment, I created an interactive multiple choice coding quiz that is timed. It also has the functionality to save high scores. Every time a question is answered incorrectly, a "wrong" message appears, as well as when answered correctly, a 'correct' message appears and the quiz continues. When a wrong answer is selected, the starting time/score of 30 is decremented/penalized by 10.

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
